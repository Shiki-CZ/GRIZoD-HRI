# GRIZoD-HRI  
**Golden Ratio-based Interaction Zone Distribution for Human-Robot Interaction**

---

## Overview

GRIZoD-HRI is an algorithm designed to optimize interaction zones between humans and robots by leveraging the Golden Ratio for spatial distribution. This approach enhances safety and comfort in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios by defining natural, balanced zones that guide robot behavior.

## Features

- Calculates interaction zones using the Golden Ratio  
- Balances safety and comfort spaces for effective HRI  
- Adaptable to various robot platforms and environments  
- Enables dynamic adjustment of zones based on real-time data
