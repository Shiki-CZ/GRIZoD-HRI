# GRIZoD-HRI  
**Golden Ratio-based Interaction Zone Distribution for Human-Robot Interaction**

---

## Overview

GRIZoD-HRI is an algorithm designed to optimize interaction zones between humans and robots by leveraging the Golden Ratio for spatial distribution. This approach enhances safety and comfort in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios by defining natural, balanced zones that guide robot behavior.
